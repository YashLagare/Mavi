# TODO for FuelPage Banner and Blur Updates

- [x] Update the motion.section in FuelPage.jsx to make it a banner: set to full width, fixed height h-[600px], make image fill with object-cover, add dark overlay with bg-black bg-opacity-50.
- [x] Update the ABOUT MAVI FUEL section in FuelPage.jsx to add a blurred background using the fuel image for continuity.
